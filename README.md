## OBBlurPicker

OBBlurPicker was written because most attempts to integrate a UIPickerView into a UI look wonky
and out of place. This was designed to be a drop in solution to that problem.

## Installation

OBBlurPicker is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'OBBlurPicker', :git => 'https://github.com/Openbay/OBBlurPicker', :tag => '1.0.0'
```
